Multimodal-Calib
================

Software used to automatically calibrate the extrinsic parameters of several sensors of different modalities.

Warning the Levinson method currently has a bug in its implementation and I am unable to find a clean way to fix it with the current interface. Because of this rather then put in an ugly hack I am leaving fixing it till I finish the version 2.0 code I am writing on the master branch.

Note currently completely restructuring layout of code and as a result the master branch is currently not in a usable state.
For the latest working code use the stable branch.
