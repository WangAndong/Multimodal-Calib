        <h3>What is it</h3>

<p>Multimodal-calib is a set of C++, CUDA and matlab functions I have written during my thesis for the automatic alignment and extrinsic calibration of different sensors. The main focus of this work has been into the use of panoramic cameras with Velodyne lidar. The methods developed however are not limited to this application and have been used for a range of multimodal 2D-2D and 2D-3D registration tasks</p>

<h3>The state of the code</h3>

<p>The code is heavily in the realm of a work in progress. I have written most of it for personal use in attempting new methods and ideas for my thesis. This means I have not concerned myself much with readability, portability or how easy it will be for others to get up and running. While I will attempted to supply some compiled libraries and Cmake files, you are probably going to need to be fairly familiar with c++, matlab and have some knowledge of sensor calibration and CUDA to get these files running on your system.</p>

<p>All that being said the documentation for the code can be found at the link below</p>
